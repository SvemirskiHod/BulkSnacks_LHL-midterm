# Bulk Snacks

## The best way to pre-order snacks, in bulk!
Inspired by bulk-barn, this is an e-commerce site for ordering snacks, similar to ritual. 

Started at the beginning of week 4 of Lighthouse Labs Web bootcamp.

_Built in 6 days with Joao Coelho from the ground up, save for a basic structure and server skeleton._

## Learned during this project (a lot!)
- Postgres & SQL-based DB schemas in general
- knex for database calls, migrations and seeds
- using Javascript Promises
- using Git in a team
- Bootstrap (definitely lots more to learn and didn't take full advantage on all pages)
- modularized routes in Express
- Twilio API
- registration page logic (from scratch, using a library would have been simpler)
- ES6 (on the back end)
- JQuery AJAX requests

## Improvements that could still be made
- lots of possible refactoring
- added site functionality (user favourites, past orders/reorder etc)
- several functions and variables not named particularly well, partly due to the time crunch
- better use of ES6, destructuring and more concise expressions
- expanded use of Bootstrap (snacks, basket pages not great on mobile)

## Getting Started

1. clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` from within the clone directory
4. open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in your favourite browser (Chrome suggested)

... and you're on your way to tasty snacks!

*Note:* Some dotenv config needed for the postgres database. For Twilio you'll need an account / API key.
